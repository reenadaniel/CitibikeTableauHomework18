An analysis for the New York Citi Bike Program, which is responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program for 200,000+ data points in the United States in order to generate visualizationa and business insights on the peak times in summer and winter periods and the top start location in New York City and New Jersey locations.

**The application aggregates the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard and story to provide answers to the following questions:**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the course of the past three years?
* How does the average trip duration change by age?
* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
* Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? 
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, it includes the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena
* It also looks at two unexpected phenomena in the data and provides a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
